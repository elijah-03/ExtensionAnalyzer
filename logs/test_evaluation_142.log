TRAINING SET PERFORMANCE (For Comparison)
======================================================================
Note: Training accuracy shows how well model fits training data.
      It should be higher than test accuracy (some overfitting is normal).

Training Accuracy:  100.00%
Training Precision: 100.00%
Training Recall:    100.00%
Training F1-Score:  100.00%

SUMMARY
======================================================================
✓ Test Accuracy:  76.74% (performance on unseen data)
✓ Train Accuracy: 100.00% (performance on training data)
⚠ Overfitting detected: 23.3pp gap between train and test

RECOMMENDATION: Use test accuracy (76.74%) when reporting model performance.
